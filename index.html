  <h1>Good Visuals</h1>
  <p1>
    It is a good visual because is one that is easy to follow, and it is somewhat eye appealing. It isn't completely ugly, and it serves its purpose. Also it is based on thorough research which adds to its strength of being good.

  <h1>Bad Visuals</h1>
  <p1>
    The visual is ugly. It is hard to follow, and very difficult to read. It provides no insight to what is going on, and leaves the viewer very confused on what they are reading. If the graph were displaying less information, then it may be more eye appealing. Also, if it were presented in another way, like a bar graph it would make it easier to read. Also it needs relative numbers to the visual to provide more insight.
